# MrKraken's String Replacements
### (English) Community Translated .ini for **Star Citizen [Build: sc-alpha-4.7.0_live_11518367]**

# Includes
- Contracts that award blueprints have the potential pool added to the end of the description
  - Not perfect, but if you want to *search* for contracts/blueprints instead [SCMDB by 🥑Krovax](https://scmdb.net/) can help
- Warning prefixes for illegal substances
- Componenet Type/Size/Grade prefixed to the name (eg.  )
- Hephaestanite (Raw) shortened to Heph (Raw)

> With thanks to [SaltEMike](https://www.twitch.tv/saltemike) for the joking idea that I ran with... [Check out his video here](https://youtu.be/K5yBt55NljE)

>[!NOTE]
> Based once again on the wonderful Language Pack idea by [ExoAE](https://github.com/ExoAE/ScCompLangPack/tree/main).

> [!WARNING]
> You will need to maintain this file in order to keep strings up-to-date with each new build/patch that modifies strings. I have an automation setup to push new versions live but please keep in mind that I am UK based and PTU builds normally go up very late UK time, so there may be a few hours delay

# Unfixable Problems
- Rayari "Need More Research Data" is a generic description/title re-used for many different contracts, most not awarding blueprints. #5
# Installation
1. Download the latest release on the right hand side
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. If you already have a user.cfg file, do not overwrite it. Instead, open your existing user.cfg and add the following line at the end `g_language = english.`
4. Copy the data folder and the (user.cfg) file into your game’s LIVE folder root.
5. Launch the game! 

```
StarCitizen/
└── LIVE/
    ├── user.cfg
    └── data/
        └── Localization/
            └── english/
                └── global.ini
```
> [!WARNING]
> This is done by find/replace operations based on extracted game data and it would be an almight task to manually check each contract personally, if you find any errors please let me know via the Issues tab.

>[!NOTE]
> To sanity check & debug why some contracts had multiple pools when it looked like there shouldn't be, Claude was used to look over the files & parser, turns out there are regional variations in Pyro 🤷‍♂️
